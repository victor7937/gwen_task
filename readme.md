# Java Tasks

## Task 1: Strings
Check if the given string is a palindrome.

## Task 2: Loops
Find the nth number of the Fibonacci sequence.

## Task 3: Arrays
Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an integer array.

## Task 4: Multidimensional Arrays, Loops
Calculate the sum of the diagonal elements of a matrix.

## Task 5: Recursion
Calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.

## Task 6: Text Manipulation
Modify the given string to keep only unique words (non-unique words are deleted except for the first copy).

## Task 7: Loops, Binary Format
Convert a decimal number to binary format without using built-in methods.

## Task 8: Algorithms
Write a program that uses the sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to a given integer *n*.

## Task 9: Roman Empire
Implement Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. Your implementation should be able to encrypt and decrypt a string with an offset provided.

Convert a Roman numeral string to an integer.

#### More About Roman Numbers:
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M.

| Symbol | Value |
| ---    | ---   |
| I      | 1     |
| V      | 5     |
| X      | 10    |
| L      | 50    |
| C      | 100   |
| D      | 500   |
| M      | 1000  |

For example, the number 2 is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. The number 12 is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number 27 is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five, we subtract it, making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
- I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
- X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
- C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
